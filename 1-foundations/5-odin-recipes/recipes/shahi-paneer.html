    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and
        golden brown, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over the onion
        and garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet.</li>
      <li>
        cook until the excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture.</li>
      <li>stir gently so the paneer does not break apart.</li>
